# Data Structures

In computer science, data structures are used to organize and store data in a way that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Here are some common data structures used in computer science:

## Array
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element of an array can be accessed by an index, and the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it efficient to traverse through an array. However, the size of an array is fixed at the time of creation, so any insertions and deletions will be inefficient.

## Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where each node points to the next node. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Linked lists are useful when the size of a collection is dynamic and needs to grow or shrink frequently. The insertion and deletion operations are efficient in a linked list.

## Stack
A stack is a linear collection of items in which the addition and removal of items take place at one end, known as the top. Stacks are last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structures and are used for tasks such as reversing a string, undo/redo operations, and backtracking (like traversing a website history).

## Queue
A queue is a linear collection of items in which the addition of items takes place at one end, known as the back, and removal of items takes place at the other end, known as the front. Queues are first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structures and are used for tasks such as scheduling tasks and keeping track of events.

## Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to map keys to their corresponding values. Hash tables are useful for tasks such as finding values quickly and maintaining a dictionary.

## Tree
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes and edges. Each node has a parent node and zero or more child nodes. The topmost node is called the root, and the bottommost nodes are called leaves. Trees are used for tasks such as organizing data hierarchically and representing expressions.

## Graph
A graph is a collection of interconnected nodes. The nodes can represent anything, and the edges represent the connections between them. Graphs are useful for tasks such as representing networks and solving graph theory problems.

## Trie
A Trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of a key in a large data set of strings. Tries are used for tasks such as searching through large dictionaries, providing suggestions in an autocomplete feature, and sorting data

## Heap
Heap is a complete binary tree which is either a
